I need a new table in the schema called Company Licences.
Fields:
company_id (foreign key to Company, can not be null)
Licence code (text, nullable)
Licence name (text, nullable)
Licence count (number, integer)

No presentation layer is needed for this.

I need a registration form. It should be placed to src/components/setup, named registration-form.tsx
Look and feel should be similar to QuickWins Login page.

- Email (mandatory)
- Password and Password verification fields, with Password match functionality on client side. (mandatory)
- Company Full Name (mandatory)

Submitting this form:
- system should check if company exist with the provided registration number and block in case it exists.

I need a new table named: Licence
Fields: 
- ID (text)
- Name (text)
- Type (text)
No Need for Company ID field !!!!
Create, update, delete can be done by verifyGlobalAdmin TRUE users only.
For read, we will need broader access because the registration form will have to read from this in the future. 
This should be a new Menu Item under setup, which is visible to verifyGlobalAdmin TRUE users.
I need Create, Edit and Delete icons. The layout should be similar to dev-patterns with Left Pane and Right Pane. 

I need a new table named: Licence Agreement Templates
Fields: 
- ID (text)
- Valid From (Date)
- Valid To (Date)
- Price (number, 3 decimal)
- Currency (text)
- LicenceId (reference to licence record, this should give a popup lookup window to select one license record)
No Need for Company ID field !!!!
Create, update, delete can be done by verifyGlobalAdmin TRUE users only.

I need a new table named: Licence Agreements
Fields: 
- ID (text)
- Valid From (Date, nullable)
- Valid To (Date, nullable)
- Price (number, 3 decimal, nullable)
- Currency (text, nullable)
- Licence Count (number, integer, nullable)
- Licence Agreement Template ID (reference to licence agreement template record, this should give a popup lookup window to select one license agreement template record)
- Company ID (reference key to a company record)
Create, update, delete can be done by verifyGlobalAdmin TRUE users only.
It is possible for verifyCompanyAdmin TRUE users to read database records where the CompanyId of the record is same as the user's company context. But so far no layout modification is needed for that purpose.
We need separate api to get all licence agreement records for a given company but this is available for verifyGlobalAdmin TRUE users. 
This should be a new Menu Item under setup, which is visible to verifyGlobalAdmin TRUE users.
I need Create, Edit and Delete icons. The layout should be similar to dev-patterns with Left Pane and Right Pane. 
On the Licence Agreement record the following fields should be populated based on the Licence Agreement Template record values: the Valid From, Valid To, Price, Currency.
