I want to modify quote-detail page.

Requirement 1: 
The current Edit button should be named Edit Quote header and should be moved into the "Quote Details" card.

Requirement 2: 
Under the Card "Quote Details", I need a new Card named "Products".
Requirement 2.1: 
The new "Products" Card suppose to appear first on the Form, once the Quote record is Saved and gets its quote_id.
Requirement 2.2: 
When the new "Products" Card appear first on the Form, it should be in View Mode and an Edit Lines button should appear in the Products Card, being enabled.
Requirement 2.3: 
Quote Details card and Products card should never be in Edit mode at the same time.
When the user hits Edit button on Quote Detail page to edit Quote record AND the Products Card is in Edit mode at that moment --> 
	Quote Lines must be saved.
	The Product Card must turn in View mode.
	Quote Detail must turn into Edit mode.

When the Quote is in View mode -->
	An "Edit Lines" button should be enabled in the Products Card, otherwise disabled.

Requirement 2.4:
The new "Products" Card suppose to list Quote Line records that belong to the Quote record.

Requirement 2.5:
The outlook should not be a simple Grid but rather a series of Line Sections repeating as many times below each other as many Quote Lines are. 
All Line Sections should appear in Edit Mode or View Mode as a whole --> this means that it is the whole Products Card that can be in Edit or View mode, rather than single Line Sections.
Icons should appear to remove an existing or add a new Quote Line.

Requirement 2.6:
Put all Quote Line fields onto the Layout, we'll adjust their order and behavior later.
One Line Section can take up to 3 rows of fields - due to the many fields.

Requirement 2.7:
When user hits Save Changes button on the Products Card, all records must go for Creation and / or Update.

Requirement 2.8:
Take these into consideration when you come up with a solution approach:
I'll specify calculation rules to some of the Quote Line fields, that will be dependent on other Quote Line field values. 
I want those calculations to happen real-time on client side.
Later, I'll specify requirements that some fields must become dynamically enabled or disabled based on conditions of other Quote Line field values or whether a user changed and other field. 



Commit message should be: Implement Products (QLI editor) section on Quote Detail Page
