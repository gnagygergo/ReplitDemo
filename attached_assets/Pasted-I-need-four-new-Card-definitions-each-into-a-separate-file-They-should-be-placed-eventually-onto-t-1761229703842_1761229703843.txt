I need four new Card definitions, each into a separate file. They should be placed eventually onto the account-details.tsx page, over the account-quote-list-card.tsx view. The way these four new Cards are to be embedded into account-detail.tsx, should follow the patterns of how account-quote-list-card.tsx is embedded. 

Details of these four new Cards:

Label: Contacts
account-company-contacts-list-card.tsx
Shows children accounts that are CompanyContact TRUE
Columns: Account Name, Email, Phone
Available action on the card: New. This should show a popup form (with Save and Cancel buttons) that shows the smart-account-management-detail-card.tsx embedded, preselected the checkbox Company Contact.

Label: Shipping Addresses
account-shipping-adresses-list-card.tsx
Shows children accounts that are ShippingAddress TRUE
Columns: Account Name, Address
Available action on the card: New. This should show a popup form (with Save and Cancel buttons) that shows the smart-account-management-detail-card.tsx embedded, preselected the checkbox Shipping Address.

Label: Sub Legal Entities
account-sub-accounts-list-card.tsx
Shows children accounts that are LegalEntity TRUE
Columns: Account Name, Address
Available action on the card: New. This should show a popup form (with Save and Cancel buttons) that shows the smart-account-management-detail-card.tsx embedded, preselected the checkbox Legal Entity.

Label: Parent Accounts
account-parent-accounts-list-card.tsx
Shows all Parent Accounts
Columns: Account Name, Address

All of these 4 cards should be visible when the given Account record is LegalEntity TRUE or ShippingAddress TRUE.
This visibility rule should be part of the card definition files.

As for the New button that should be placed to 3 out of the 4 cards, here are my thoughts:
- the popup form that I mentioned should preselect a checkbox of the Account Nature section (explained earlier)
- despite the preselection, the "Account Nature" section should be HIDDEN in the popup form. And I think this makes it necessary to modify the smart-account-management-detail-card.tsx file: it should have a new parameter: showAccountNature.  showAccountNature should be FALSE when calling it by the New buttons on these four new cards, but showAccountNature should be TRUE when calling by the account-detail.tsx
