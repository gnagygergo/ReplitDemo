Now I'd like to enhance Detail Views with the capability to show Related Lists. Related List should be a section on the detail view of a record "A" that shows collection of "B" records that are linked to the "A" record through a Lookup Field relationship. 
One challenge is that there is no database level connection: the relationship is represented via a field definition XML, for example: client/src/companies/b5d0bae9-10b2-410c-8553-c41143182211/objects/assets/fields/productId.field_meta.xml

<RelatedList>
objectCode="asset"
fieldCode="productId"
columns="name, description"
mode={isEditing ? "edit" : "view"}
</RelatedList>

How it should work: 
Let's say that the above code snippet is added to client/src/companies/b5d0bae9-10b2-410c-8553-c41143182211/objects/products/layouts/product-detail.detail_view_meta.tsx
The system finds the field definition XML under asset/fields/productId.field_meta.xml and finds the <relationshipApiCode>assets</relationshipApiCode>
If we are on the detail view of Product record "A" , the system should fetch all records from the Asset table that has the Product "A" record referenced in the productId column. 
We need to assume that an API endpoint exists for GET [referencedObject]/[productId]/[relationshipApiCode]
The best would be to have a generic endpoint for this that can fetch records for any object's relationships.
The columns prop should drive the Related List UI component on which columns to show of the objectCode="asset" in the grid. 
I'd like mode prop to support edit and view both because I'll want certain field types (FieldText, DateTimeField, DropdownFormField, CheckboxField, NumbderField) be editable in the grid.
I let you design how the rest of the props should work for this <RelatedList> UI tag:
value
testId
The <RelatedList> tag should provide the Detail View on the UI with a Card, and the Grid. 
Examine client/src/companies/b5d0bae9-10b2-410c-8553-c41143182211/objects/products/layouts/product-detail.detail_view_meta.tsx to build feasibility.
