I need a new table named: Licence
Fields: 
- ID (text)
- Name (text)
- Type (text)
No Need for Company ID field !!!!
Create, update, delete can be done by verifyGlobalAdmin TRUE users only.
For read, we will need broader access because the registration form will have to read from this in the future. 
This should be a new Menu Item under setup, which is visible to verifyGlobalAdmin TRUE users.
I need Create, Edit and Delete icons. The layout should be similar to dev-patterns with Left Pane and Right Pane. 

I need a new table named: Licence Agreement Templates
Fields: 
- ID (text)

- Currency (text)

It is possible for verifyCompanyAdmin TRUE users to read database records where the CompanyId of the record is same as the user's company context. But so far no layout modification is needed for that purpose.
We need separate api to get all licence agreement records for a given company but this is available for verifyGlobalAdmin TRUE users.
